Roasting has been fun; I started after reading [this article](http://www.kinfolk.com/home-roasting-coffee/) from Kinfolk Mag. I bought an popcorn air-popper at goodwill for like $4 and bought some green coffee beans from [Sweet Maria's](https://www.sweetmarias.com/) who I highly recommend. 

After doing 20g roasts at a time, my family (I think, 2 years ago) bought me a Behmor [^1] Coffee roaster. It looks a little like the lovechild of a microwave and a rotisserie oven, with a spinning drum in the center and a heating element at the back. 

Timing coffee is really interesting, it almost feels similar to cooking pop-corn
