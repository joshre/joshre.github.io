I started doing this the beginning of summer 2016. I'd always liked cold brew that had a long extraction, and had been hearing people talk about Kyoto drip adjacent to [Kyoto Black](http://kyotostylecoffee.com/) in Chicago. I'm not necessarily finished with my setup, it's admittedly hobbled together, but I've found out my extraction times and measurements.

I made my own setup using an AeroPressâ€”I already had filters and coffee so it seemed like it'd be cheap and easy.

| Water | Coffee | Acity |
|:-----:|--------|-------|
| 10oz  | 10s    | 12    |
| 29oz  | 12s    | 12    |
| 18oz  | 11s    | 8     |

It had been coming out way too grassy and weak for a while until I heard Justin Doggett explain that kyoto really needs a darker roast for the extraction to go anywhere interesting.

<!-- It'd be cool to try making some sort of Liqueur by running something like 500ml of spirit (lets say, bourbon) through a drip and then taking that and hitting it with N<sub>2</sub>O, you could throw an over-flavored vanilla ice-cream (or a really vanilla-ey foam/whip) and make a really interesting strong Affogato. -->
