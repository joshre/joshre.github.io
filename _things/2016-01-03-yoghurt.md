### 01/03/16

* Jars went in 12:35pm
* Water 43Â° C
* first jar out at 6:04 straight to ice bath 

Too milky â€” needed more time or needs a stronger starter

### 8/20
- 800 g whole milk
- 64 g yogurt 
- When yogurt went in, didn't completely incorporate â€” added somewhat evenly to the milk and shaken before added to water bath

Went in at 1:10 am
Water bath 109Â° F

#### final notes

Needs to stay at 180Â° longer (I think), didn't have a fully formed consistent solid texture so maybe a bit longer will help the casein denature enough to make it thick?
