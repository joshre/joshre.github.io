Hey there, I'm Josh. I get a kick out of making stuff. From ties, belts, food, to the web I make, break, and fix things. I'm a web developer currently working at [Bamboo Creative](http://bamboocreative.com) in Sacramento, CA. Most places on the internet you can find me as `joshre`. lets be friends there.
