Hey, I'm Josh. I get a kick out of making stuff and have a lot of hobbies. From food, drinks, to the web I make, break, and fix things.

I'm a web developer working at [Honey](https://workbyhoney.com/) in Sacramento, CA. Most places on the internet you can generally find me as `joshre`. lets be friends there. If you're into **Twitter** my username is [@_joshre](http://twitter.com/_joshre), on **Github** you can find me under [joshre](http://github.com/joshre), and if you like music I'm [@joshre](https://music.apple.com/profile/joshre) on apple music.
