Hey, I'm Josh. I get a kick out of making stuff and have a lot of hobbies. From food, drinks, to the web I make, break, and fix things.

I'm a web developer working at [Honey Agency](http://honeyagency.com/) in Sacramento, CA. Most places on the internet you can generally find me as `joshre`. lets be friends there. If you're into **Twitter** my username is [@jawshre](http://twitter.com/jawshre), on **Github** you can find me under [joshre](http://github.com/joshre), and if you like pictures I'm [joshre](http://instagram.com/joshre) on **Instagram**.



<!-- __Things I've Been Making__  
I post some of the things I make from time-to-time . Pretty much everything's from the kitchen: Drinks, food, tinctures and what-not.
