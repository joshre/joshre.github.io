Hey, I'm Josh. I get a kick out of making stuff. From ties, belts, food, to the web: I make, break, and fix things.

I'm a web developer working at [Honey Agency](http://honeyagency.com/) in Sacramento, CA. Most places on the internet you can generally find me as `joshre`. lets be friends there. If you're into **Twitter** my username is [@jawshre](http://twitter.com/jawshre), on **Github** you can find me under [joshre](http://github.com/joshre), and if you like pictures I'm [joshre](http://instagram.com/joshre) on **Instagram**.



__Things I've cobbled together__  
I made a thing to get your [snapcode](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/ca/snapcode) as an SVG â€” and there's a list of quotes and verses I've randomly been adding to over the years.
