These are super easy since I've started making Lime Cordial; and though there's no problem with hard work , there's no problem when it's a piece-of-cake. The cordial takes a little bit of the acidic edge off of the limes, which can be nice at times, but I'll add brightness back by expressing a lemon peel over the top and adding a few dashes of Orange Bitters‚Äîit ties it all together nicely. Sometimes I'll throw in some lime or basil if it's in the fridge.

- 3/4 oz lime cordial
- Pinch of salt
- 2 oz gin
- 2 dashes Fee Brothers Orange Bitters
- Express a lemon wedge over the top, drop in the drink
