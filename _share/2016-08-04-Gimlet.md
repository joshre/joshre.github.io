These are the easiest cocktail to make when I've got lime cordial on hand. Expressing a lemon peel over the top and adding a few dashes of Orange Bitters adds back some of the brightness lost with the cordial.

![Gimlet with a lemon](/images/been-making/gimlet.jpg)

- 3/4 oz lime cordial
- Pinch of salt
- 2 oz gin
- 2 dashes Fee Brothers Orange Bitters
- Express a lemon wedge over the top, drop in the drink
