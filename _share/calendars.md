# Conference Room Calendars

Ladies and gentlem(a)n (grady). I have _very_ exiting news.

We're going to setup conference/buzzworthy lounge rooms, accordingly, in our calendar. Also, I'm going to explain how to add someone else's calendar to your own too keep it on your radar. You might be asking yourself "Am I ready for this?"

_Good question_â€”yes you are.

## Lets start with Room Reservations.

__How this will work.__  
There will be a __contact__ in your address book that you invite to an event that listens to our calendar items and adds them _auto-magically_ to a dedicated "room calendar". You can see the room availability when you're adding the calendar item, and If there's already something going on in there when you add an event you'll get an "Event Declined" email.

So, we'll go over the few pieces you need to make sure you're all setup to reserve rooms _like a professional._

There are two calendars.

It's added, stop here. You're golden. 


##  Adding Rooms To Your Contacts

Download the zip file of the meeting contact group linked below, and double-click it, add the two contacts to your contacts, they've got images and names there already. That's it!
