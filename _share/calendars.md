# Conference Room Calendars

__Ladies and gentlemen. I have _very_ exiting news.__

We're going to setup conference/buzzworthy lounge rooms, accordingly, in our calendar. Also, I'm going to explain how to [add someone else's calendar to your own](#showing-a-co-workers-calendar-within-your-own-calendar-app) too keep it on your radar. You might be asking yourself "Am I ready for this?"

_Good question_â€”yes you are. 

![Is such a thing possible](http://i.imgur.com/FCEYI.gif)


This page goes over how to setup all of these calculator details and [there's a test at the end](#now-that-youve-added-all-of-your-calendars-add-me-to-a-calendar-event-in-the-conference-room-to-make-sure-youre-all-setup), but this should take __12 minutes max__ of your time. 

## Lets start with Room Reservations.

__How this will work.__  
There will be a __contact__ in your address book that you invite to any event you would like to designate a room to.That contact listens to our calendar items and adds them _auto-magically_ to a dedicated "room calendar". You can see the room availability when you're adding the calendar item, and If there's already something going on in there when you add an event you'll get an "Event Declined" email.

So, we'll go over the few pieces you need to make sure you're all setup to reserve rooms _like a professional._

## Adding A Room Calendar To Your Calendar Setup

There are two calendars.

1. Conference Room
    *   `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/honeyagency.com_3633313232323637363438%40resource.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`
2. Buzzworthy Lounge
    *  `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/honeyagency.com_2d34313835333136392d313931%40resource.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`

To add it to your OSX calendar:

1. Copy (not click) the link of the calendar you're about to add (those are up there ^^)
2. Navigate to your calendar app.
3. Click `File` >  `New Calendar Group`
4. Paste in the link to the calendar (above next to calendar names)

It's added, stop here. You're golden. 


##  Adding Rooms To Your Contacts

Download the zip file of the meeting contact group linked below, and double-click it, add the two contacts to your contacts, they've got images and names there already. That's it!

[This is the zip you want](https://github.com/joshre/joshre.github.io/raw/master/_share/Meetings.zip)


## Adding A Room Reservation

This is pretty simple. 

1. Create your event
2. Under invitees type `The Buzzworthy Lounge` or `Conference` 
    * You can check the availability here
3. Click send, it will automatically handle adding the event.

## Showing a co-worker's calendar within your own calendar app. 

Keeping up-to-date on what everyone has on their radar is a lot easier if you can _get right in their business_ and look at their calendar. Currently, you can subscribe to anyone with an `@honeyagency.com` email address simply by searching for it in "other calendars" within your google calendar.

It's easier to understand if you see an example. I've added Grady's below:

## Now that you've added all of your calendars, add me to a calendar event in the conference room, to make sure you're all setup.

# You're done
