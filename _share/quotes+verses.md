title: Quotes & Verses
---

This is a un-organized list of quotes & verses I've held together in a markdown file for years, it's _somewhat_ chronological. When I hear something I like and happen to remember this file exists, I throw it in here—so these are things that really caught my attention in some way. Generally, verses have appropriate translation, and some quotes have sources.

##### On Listening to Lectures.  
The correct analogy for the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting — no more — and then it motivates one towards originality and instills the desire for truth. Suppose someone were to go and ask his neighbors for fire and find a substantial blaze there, and just stay there continually warming himself: that is no different from someone who goes to someone else to get to some of his rationality, and fails to realize that he ought to ignite his own flame, his own intellect, but is happy to sit entranced by the lecture, and the words trigger only associative thinking and bring, as it were, only a flush to his cheeks and a glow to his limbs; but he has not dispelled or dispersed, in the warm light of philosophy, the internal dank gloom of his mind.

I’ve ran with dozens of business ideas. But I couldn’t teach you a thing about entrepreneurialism that’d be worth a damn, other than “stop thinking, stop learning, start doing“.

So avoid using the word ‘very’ because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don’t use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won’t do in your essays.

How do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. While fans of the television show Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once created consumer desire during Madison Avenue’s golden era, those days are long gone.
