# Making Seltzer With A Whipper 

_[From Dave Arnold's Liquid Intelligence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eruqa4jfoa3tdg6/Liquid%20Intelligence_%20The%20Art%20and%20Science%20o%20-%20Dave%20Arnold.epub?dl=0)_

Cream whippers use 7.5-gram cartridges of gas: CO2 for soda, N2O for whipped cream. Compared to any other form of buying CO2, these cartridges are superexpensive—up to a dollar apiece. You’ll need at least two of them every time you carbonate. Even worse, you cannot control the pressure inside; your only choice is whether or not to add another 8-gram cartridge.

If you must carbonate using a cream whipper, keep it in the freezer for a while before you carbonate, because the vessel has enough steel in it to significantly warm your drink. I also recommend throwing an ice cube or two into the whipper along with your chilled beverage. Scale your recipe to make enough mix to fill your whipper approximately one-third full. Don’t fill the whipper more than halfway. Try to keep your fill levels the same all the time: the pressure in the bottle—and therefore the level of carbonation you get—is dependent on the fill line. Before you screw the top on, make sure the valve is clean—it easily gets filled with schmutz if you use the whipper for infusions—and that its main gasket is in place. If either of those two things is messed up, the whipper won’t pressurize and you will have wasted a cartridge.

Now put in your first CO2 cartridge and shake the whipper violently. After you shake it, hold it upright and use the dispensing handle to vent out the headspace air and to blast the air off potential nucleation sites in the cocktail. If cocktail starts spraying out the top, release the handle and wait a second before resuming your vent. After the cocktail is vented, add another CO2 cartridge and shake again. Let the whipper sit undisturbed for a while so the drink settles before you slowly vent the gas. To serve, unscrew the top and pour.
