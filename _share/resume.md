**I have been working on the web for over a decade, with experience in every
discipline relevant to putting ideas on the internet.** From design briefs,
wireframes, and mockups to content management, project management, server
administration, shipping, and maintaining websites. I’ve worked with
restaurants, the wine industry, churches, hotels, farms, large-scale commodity
boards, and e-commerce shops. Most recently, I focused on a single product,
leading feature development informed by user needs and feedback.

My strength is not just in full-stack development. Due to years in agencies and
a fascination with design, I have a high capacity for it—from interpreting and
executing the work of designers to filling in gaps that inevitably come up in
the process of making a thing. **Words matter,** especially when you're
publishing something on the internet, and I don't shy away from writing as an
engineer.

### Engineering

I've worked with countless languages, web frameworks, and CMS platforms; enough
that picking up a new RESTful architecture is pretty simple and a fun endeavor.

In my agency time, I built websites that worked _for_ our clients. Not
GPU-hungry webpage builders, but custom-tailored CMS dashboards that had the
flexibility to adapt and grow with their business, while being rigid enough to
not overload someone less technically savvy. The goal was to build something
that wouldn't later require an engineer to make something look good and remain
accessible.

Working in a product company, the focus was constantly providing value for those
who used the product and solving the problems of people who hadn't used it yet.
We ran a mostly test-driven Rails monolith that let us iterate fast and respond
to feedback from users. Time was spent ensuring we didn't introduce future
technical debt by optimizing queries and taking the time to sketch and design
systems before we started to build them. It was rewarding work.

#### Front End

When a project allows for it, I love working with in-browser animation. From
butter-smooth transitions between pages and states to the more detailed
implementation working with After Effects exports for SVG animation, it's all a
treat.

<video muted autoplay loop class="float-right mx-auto mr-4 ml-4 -mt-2 w-1/5 rounded-xl ring-1 transform-gpu rotate-2 sm:ml-6 sm:w-2/5 lg:ml-8 lg:rounded-2xl ring-soil-900 bg-soil-50" >

  <source src="../../images/family-guy-css.mp4" >
</video>

<span class="font-medium">I'm the guy that still likes CSS</span>, and I'm
comfortable making it do whatever is needed. Good semantic CSS & HTML are like
cleaning the sink before you go to bed or brushing your teeth: it separates us
from the animals.

#### Performance

I have spent a lot of time focusing a ton on performance. The internet gods
reward speed and lightness, and every MB counts in the LCP, FCP, CLS wars.
Additionally, the web just _feels_ better when the bottleneck isn't a 4 MB VSCO
jpeg in the background of the footer. In a product, this ends up being pretty
simple, but with high-touch client work it takes a lot to strike a balance when
the brand has 3 fonts and the client just paid 5k for a photo shoot of their
products. Working with responsive images, lazy- & pre- loading, caching, and
utilizing CDNs and edge networks, I found ways to meet in the middle.

#### A11y

I strive to hit good accessibility standards. It all should work for everyone,
and the work to make that possible really isn't all that hard. Accessibility
ends up creating benefits for folks that don't need any assistive technology in
the first place, and usually, it just looks like building things with valid
syntax. Additionally, we experienced numerous hotels that would get drive-by ADA
lawsuits because of a failed lighthouse test, or government contracts that had
an extremely high standards based on what the de rigueur WCAG was at the time.

### Servers / DevOps

- **Git** — I've used it solely to manage CI, to work in a PR process with code
  review, or simply to manage my projects.
- **CI** — I've worked with various systems—with and without a test suite.
  Heroku, Beanstalk, GitHub actions.
- **Servers** — Setting up, managing, and maintaining servers was my
  bread-and-butter for agency work. Linux, AWS, Heroku, Linode, all the WordPress
  ones. Doing it ourselves meant low-cost, which helped to make maintenance
  contracts viable.
- **DNS / CDNs** — Similarly, agency work gives any developer their fair-share
  of experience managing DNS records, hunting down someone's GoDaddy account, and
  handling CDNs.

### Design

While I wouldn't claim expertise at something like brand development, I'm very
comfortable designing interfaces and webpages. 10 years of needing to develop an
eye for typography and color, as well as the early days of <span
  class="text-nowrap"><span
    class="font-vulf">&ldquo;</span><em>pixel-perfect</em><span
    class="inline-flex relative translate-x-px font-vulf -translate-y-[0.5px]">&rdquo;</span></span>
project scopes, taught me how to build according to a design and interpret the
designer's intent. I’ve collaborated extensively with designers to realize their
vision within a project's scope—whether expanding it or refining the design to
hit a deadline.

- **Figma** — This is all I use today.
- **Illustrator, Photoshop** — I used the Adobe suite for years (Bamboo &
  Honey), _but these days I prefer not to install malware on my computer_
  <sup>[sic]</sup>. I'll reach into Illustrator if I'm trying to do something with
  an SVG that I simply can't get Figma to do.

### The Other Stuff

#### CMS / CRM / eCommerce

&ldquo;Other people's tools that need to work with ours.&rdquo; I've integrated
a handful of CRMs into various products, built multiple Shopify sites, been
tasked with implementing arcane winery-specific e-commerce integrations with
little-to-no-documentation—in short, I'm used to working with tools that don't
always make the integration process simple and require problem-solving and
"discovery" to make them work.

#### HTML Email

This one feels strange to single out, but special beasts live in special places.
I spent a ton of time building out custom emails for various clients on various
systems (MailChimp, HubSpot, Constant Contact, Intercom, SendGrid etc.) with all
of their various syntactic sugar. Love it or hate it: email makes money, and
making HTML emails is somehow still like building webpages in 2006.

#### Writing

Everywhere I've worked, I've enjoyed writing. Either in lieu of Lorem Ipsum, or
simply being a professional that needed to communicate clearly with clients.
<small>I'll concede: sometimes I could use an editor.</small>

#### Team / Communications

Similarly, I enjoy working with and communicating with clients; I always
presented my own work and would train clients directly—whatever their skill
set—on how to use the things we built. I've worked in teams where extreme detail
was beloved as well as teams where minimal communication was extolled, I thrive
in each. I've worked for years at a time in-person and for years at a time
remote, I believe both have their advantages. It feels odd to note but, yes:
Word, Google Sheets, Notion, Pages, Basecamp, Jira, Slack etc.

### MxU

<span
  class="font-mono text-base font-medium tracking-tight"><strong>Engineer</strong>
\| October 2020 - August 2024</span>

MxU’s core product is a Rails app used to train worship and tech teams in video,
audio, lighting, and leadership. We built and maintained a product that helped
folks in charge of making the weekend happen train volunteers in local churches
across the world. **In my 4 years there we more than tripled MRR**, saw ARR hit
major milestones, and worked within a team that grew from 2 to 12.

I came on as the first employee and was solely responsible for product for a
short period, later working with two other engineers in varying capacities.

In my time at MxU, I wore many hats. I built a few marketing sites, developed
numerous marketing pages for business partnerships, tightly integrated business
logic and marketing functions between HubSpot and our application, created a
merch site on Shopify, and built an annual conference site that tied into
eventbrite.

**I’m most proud of my design contributions to MxU**. Though we had a dedicated
designer for branding and asset creation—such as video thumbnails and social
media content—as a development team we worked on our own, sketching and
designing in the browser as we went.

### Honey

<span class="font-mono text-base font-medium tracking-tight"><strong>Senior
Developer</strong> \| Feb 2016 - October 2020</span>

Honey is an agency I worked at in Sacramento, CA whose niche is catering to
food, beverage, and agriculture clients. They do everything from branding,
packaging, marketing campaigns, to website development. Often it included
everything. I frequently referred to myself as the online print shop. I worked
with the design team early in the process to bring client ideas to life. Years
later many of the sites we built are heavily used with little change, which I'm
quite proud of.

### Bamboo Creative

<span class="font-mono text-base font-medium tracking-tight"><strong>Web
Developer</strong> Jan, 2012 – Jan, 2016</span>

Bamboo is where I cut my teeth as a web developer.

Responsibilities Included: Sketching, wire-framing, building, deploying, and
maintaining websites for Bamboo's clients start-to-finish. Work ranged from
small single-page sites to custom WordPress themes built on WordPress Multisite
Networks.

- Setting up LAMP stacks and integrating deployment based on git.
- Building CSS pattern-libraries for sites.
- Writing site documentation.
- Managing and monitoring over 20 client sites at a time.

### Trestle Leather Co

<span
  class="font-mono text-base font-medium tracking-tight"><strong>Owner</strong>
Jun, 2010 – Jan, 2013</span>

I ran an Etsy shop that sold belts and wallets in the last part of high school,
I started with raw materials and successfully shipped products for a little over
a year and a half. I shipped products to the USA, Germany, Australia, and Japan;
managed a budget and expenses, learning how to leverage bulk purchases and
product timing.

### Hollister co.

<span class="font-mono text-base font-medium tracking-tight"><strong>Team
Member</strong> Sep, 2010 – Jan, 2012</span>

I can sense you're backing away.

I can hear you thinking to yourself: “how is this remotely relevant to a
software engineer?” While this is a valid question, it misses two crucial
points.

Firstly, it means I hate the mall now. Just the smell Gordon Biersch fries or a
glimpse of an Auntie Annes is enough to bring back the smell of the oil leak on
my ’96 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, left unlocked in the parking lot as I ran in
5 minutes late—a memory that vacillates between nostalgia and my at-the-time
anxiety in a way I’d rather keep buried in cold storage.

Secondly, and maybe more importantly: I have years of experience folding shirts.
Regardless of industry, ever company I’ve worked at _at some point_ decided the
best thing to do that month was print some t-shirts—it’s payed dividends.
