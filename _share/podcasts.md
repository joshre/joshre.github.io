# Open Ideas

### Show format & Process.
We want this to be something that we can sustain, so it's going to lack a level of production that will drive any of us into the ground. That means it will look a lot more like a conversation that may or may not be cut up and edited; preferably we'd see a max of 4 hours put into an episode (recording, editing, mixing down, and publishing).

##### Record
This will probably be a bunch of people around a few microphones, we'll change it as we go if the sound isn't great with that setup. Think *conversation* more than anything else. A few prepared segments can be easy ways to fill some space, that way we're not banking on our open-ended ability to hold an interesting conversation for 30 min.

##### Edit
We'll have separate audio tracks from each mic, so we'll need to take those and throw them into whatever DAW we're using, make sure that the levels (volume) match up, make everyone's voice sounds nice; cut up and insert intro music, ad-read music, music between segments, etc.

##### Mix-down and "screen"
After that we'll do a rough listen (screen in the office? idk.), save the track, and upload it to our feed. At this point we've shipped something—which is a big deal—and that makes me feel like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pgkhiLT.gif).

##### Share, spam, proselytize 
Now we share this like it's our life's work. Like a newbie to pampered-chef or cutco—you best friends are *your best friends.*

## Other Shows
This is a big list of a bunch of other podcasts that have unique formats. These pretty much all break from the normal "two people talking arround a mic" format and try something different. I embedded audio players to make them easy to listen to—but their show links are also available if you have a podcathcer you like. I'll put a few recommendations below.

### IDEO Futures
{: .center}
*Where entrepreneurship meets design*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.ideo %}

##### Why It’s Good
Open to changes, updates and experimenting. There’s a really consistent reflection of the hosts’ personalities, and each throws their own spin on subjects based on their expertise. They have a few segments that give them a “safety” to fall-back on where they can play to their strengths, i.e. they have a segment called “Venture Design That Blows Are Minds,” where they just spend a few minutes talking about the things they already think about all day. The show has a really good mix of expertise and informality; if our format edges near this one, we're in a good spot.

----

#### RadioLab
{: .center}
*Radiolab is an investigation told through sounds and stories, and centered around one big idea. In the Radiolab world, information sounds like music and science and culture collide.*
{: .center}

We're not going to do anything close to radiolab, but it's worth hearing what can be done with a podcast format.

{% include episode.html episode=page.radiolab %}

##### Why It’s Good
Radiolab is a tour de force of radio storytelling, they spend an inordinate amount of time editing in sound effects, layering interviews, and adding explanations here-and-there. This is what one of their audio files looks like:

![Radiolab Pro Tools File](http://i.imgur.com/oEgEoAy.jpg)
{: .full-img}

They generally focus on one question or subject leaning towards science and spend an hour or so taking it apart. They talk to experts, people involved in the subject, and understand their audience has a curious mind. They've managed to make an incredibly visual art out of a strictly-audio format.

----

#### Question of the day
{: .center}
*Question of the Day is the show for listeners who are short on time and long on curiosity.*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.qotd %}

##### Why It’s Good
These are 10 minute episodes with James Altucher and Freakonomics co-author Stephen Dubner. They're pretty much just taking questions people ask on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/). It's really fast paced with only a few breaks for music. Their powerhouse is the ability to ask great interview questions of one-another; there's no *basic* questions—that'd be boring. 


----

#### Immutable
{: .center}
*A short, weekly show about design and development hosted by Sam Soffes & Bryn Jackson.*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.immutable %}

##### Why It’s Good
Immutable is made up of five 3-minute segments. They have 5 questions and the segment is on a timer, once it's up they move on. It seems like a good constraint that forces you to not over-think a format. 

----

#### Reply All
{: .center}
*A show about the internet, hosted by PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman. From Gimlet.*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.replyall %}

##### Why It’s Good
Reply All touts itself as "a show about the internet"—so it features stories and segments all about people's interaction with the internet and the way it affects their daily lives. They range from surface-level stories and humor to really emotional and in-depth accounts of people's lives. This episode starts about email and then ends up as a story about a Nazi camp, it's really interesting. They also have some great segments, like *Yes, Yes, No* — where they bring their boss in and have him ask about some vague thing on the internet and attempt to explain it to him. [Listen to this one](https://overcast.fm/+DzGWydmSM/0:55)

#### Planet Money
{: .center}
*Money makes the world go around, faster and faster every day. On NPR’s Planet Money, you’ll meet high rollers, brainy economists and regular folks — all trying to make sense of our rapidly changing global economy.*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.planetmoney %}

##### Why It’s Good
Planet Money is usually somewhere between 20-30 minutes. It's packed full of smart stuff, and is quick for a short commute.

----

> These next ones aren't necessarily a format that we're going for but they're high-quality shows, and some of my favorites. And since I enjoy them so much, I want *you* to enjoy them just as much.

<br>

#### This American Life
{: .center}
*This American Life is a weekly public radio show, heard by 2.2 million people on more than 500 stations.*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.thisamericanlife %}

##### Why It’s Good
This American Life was one of the first "podcasts" that *really* got traction (which is why they're on the upper-side of 500 episodes); they're usually broken up in to 3 sections—or "acts"—as Ira Glass, the host, reffers them. 

----

#### Serial
{: .center}
*A new podcast from the creators of This American Life*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.serial %}

##### Listen to Serial
Who do you think did it?

----

#### StartUp
{: .center}
*The business origin story you never get to hear*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.startup %}

##### Why It’s Good
Alex Bloomberg was at *Planet Money* for a long time and was really successful, he broke off to make a podcast network that's a lot closer to a startup, and this is the whole story of that. Really inspiring, pretty funny, check it out.

#### Home of the Brave
{: .center}
*Radio stories by Scott Carrier*
{: .center}

{% include episode.html episode=page.hotb %}

##### Why It’s Good
Scott Carrier is my favorite storyteller. He's monotone, sometimes confusing to follow, and incredibly dark; but he's *so* good at capturing listeners. You never know where he's going, or why—but it's always interesting.
