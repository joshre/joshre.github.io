# Podcasts

This started out as me throwing together a list of a few numbers-ey related podcasts and then it slowly turned into a larger list, and then it became a half-baked "these-are-the-podcasts-I-like" list and that's pretty much where it stands now. hope you enjoy _curated content._

## 99% Invisible
This one's about design, stuff, and things. The host, [Roman Mars](https://twitter.com/romanmars), is unique and you might've heard his [TED Talk about Flag Design](https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed?language=en) which I also recommend. They recently did an [episode about china towns](https://overcast.fm/+DAyMpHU) (like, the ones you see in cities) and it's crazy good.

## Home of The Brave
Home of the brave is done by scott carier, and I think he's one of the best storytellers I've ever heard. It's one of my absolute favorites.

## Freakonomics Radio
Freakonomics is from the guys who _wrote_ freakonomics, the host talks a lot about larger economic questions and interviews a lot of economists and various smart people. It's really good.

## Invisibila
Invisibilia is a _really_ good one and I can't wait for it to come back (they're on "break" between seasons). I don't know their last names but the hosts, Alix and Lulu, are from this american life (I think?) and the whole thing is a deep-dive into the human mind and how we act. It's one of those "mix of science and storytelling" shows and its so friggin' good.

## Planet Money
You've probably heard planet money, it's a big NPR podcast, each one is somewhere in the realm of 15-20min so they're bite-sized enough for a commute. It's all about money, economics, yadyada.

## What's The Point
What's the point is a podcast from [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) (cute little fox logo site) and is pretty numbers-heavy so it's a good listen. They talk about pretty much anything related to numbers.

## Radiolab
Radiolab is another one you've probably heard of, but here it is again since it's so good. Some of the best storytelling-mixed-with-science on the interweb.

Also, those are links from the podcast app I use called [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) â€” it's really good, the smartspeed thingy is my jam.
