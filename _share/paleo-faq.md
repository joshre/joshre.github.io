### FAQ

The paleo shoes website uses something called "accordions." Accordions are a list of headers that can be clicked to hide or reveal additional content, and in this case the __question__ is the header and the __answer__ is the additional content. We do give users an overview of the information available to them without requiring them to process all of it at once. We'll look at how to edit/add a __question__ and then we'll look at editing/adding an __answer__.

We will be making changes to the back-end of the FAQ page. To edit the FAQ, navigate to the FAQ (while logged in) and click "edit page."
