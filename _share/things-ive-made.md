Big 'ol list of things I've made

# Carbonation

My CO<sub>2</sub> rig is pretty much copied from Dave Arnold's Liquid intelligence,[^1] it consists of:

* 5lb CO<sub>2</sub> tank [^2]
* [Pressure Regulator](http://amzn.to/1UB61fL) (the sort you get for a home brew setup)
* [CarbaCap](http://amzn.to/1UB4XID)[^3] — these are clever, screw it onto a soda-bottle cap and all you need is a ball-lock adapter to force in some gas.
* [5/16" Gas Line Assembly - Ball Lock](http://amzn.to/1UB5TNh)

## CO<sub>2</sub> Whiskey Sours

With whiskey sours, you usually shake your ingredients with egg white before you throw in ice to chill them, it forces in some air and gives it a nice texture. These are cool because you're substituting the egg with the texture of the CO<sub>2</sub>. An egg-white Whiskey sour and a carbonated one aren't really comparable—they're _just_ different enough to kinda be different products. 

1. Mix
2. Chill (ideally between –5° and –10°C)
3. Carbonate

## Roasting

Roasting has been fun; I started after reading [this article](http://www.kinfolk.com/home-roasting-coffee/) from Kinfolk Mag. I bought an popcorn air-popper at goodwill for like $4 and bought some green coffee beans from [Sweet Maria's](https://www.sweetmarias.com/) who I highly recommend.

[^2]: If you're in Sacramento, hit up [Brew Ferment Distill](http://brewfermentdistill.com/) — $90 deposit w/ a $20 refill—I'll only probably end up re-filling 3-4 times a year, it's a lot of gas.
