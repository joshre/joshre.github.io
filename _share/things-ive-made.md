# Carbonation


My CO<sub>2</sub> rig is pretty much copied from Dave Arnold's Liquid intelligence,[^1] it consists of:

* 5lb CO<sub>2</sub> tank [^2]
* [Pressure Regulator](http://amzn.to/1UB61fL) (the sort you get for a home brew setup)
* [CarbaCap](http://amzn.to/1UB4XID)[^3] — these are clever, screw it onto a soda-bottle cap and all you need is a ball-lock adapter to force in some gas.
* [5/16" Gas Line Assembly - Ball Lock](http://amzn.to/1UB5TNh)

## CO<sub>2</sub> Whiskey Sours

With whiskey sours, you usually shake your ingredients with egg white before you throw in ice to chill them, it forces in some air and gives it a nice texture. These are cool because you're substituting the egg with the texture of the CO<sub>2</sub>. An egg-white Whiskey sour and a carbonated one aren't really comparable—they're _just_ different enough to kinda be different products. 

When you're carbonating, it's pretty important that the liquid you're about to force CO<sub>2</sub> into is as clear as possible. Bubbles form on any solute (the thing dissolving _into_ your liquid) that's floating around in there. To help, I use [Pectinase](http://amzn.to/2665YAz) (it's the stuff they use to clear up wine) to break-down the cloudy bits in the lemon juice.

1. Mix
2. Chill (ideally between –5° and –10°C)
3. Carbonate

# Coffee   
Like a lot of things that I've started making and have fallen in love with, coffee started out as me trying to find a cost-effective way to have _okayish_ coffee all the time. My options were:

1. Infrequent __great__[^4] coffee
2. Consistent __okay__ [^5] coffee
3. Crap coffee
4. No Coffee

In this case, I prefer the __No Coffee__ to the __Crap Coffee__ (sour coffee) [^6] but didn't want to throw down the cash for the __Great Coffee__.  

## Roasting

Roasting has been fun; I started after reading [this article](http://www.kinfolk.com/home-roasting-coffee/) from Kinfolk Mag. I bought an popcorn air-popper at goodwill for like $4 and bought some green coffee beans from [Sweet Maria's](https://www.sweetmarias.com/) who I highly recommend. 

## Kyoto (Slow Drip Cold-Brew)

It'd be cool to try making some sort of Liqueur by running something like 500ml of spirit (lets say, bourbon) through a drip and then taking that and hitting it with N<sub>2</sub>O, you could throw an over-flavored vanilla ice-cream (or a really vanilla-ey foam/whip) and make a really interesting strong Affogato.
