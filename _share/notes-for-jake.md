* when settings are saved, alerts at the top of the page are duplicated if done sequentially
* Setting up a project might be easier if there's a "timeline" or completion context. Like a status bar at the top of the page where you can go back in the process.
	* For example, I added the button to my site, saw that it worked and wanted to go "back" a step to make the feedback option private, because I remembered there being a setting to allow feedback by invite or from anyone.
* Might be too nitty-gritty, but "Upgrade From Trial" ought to be a more comfortable or inviting color than red, it feels like I'm doing something wrong by not  signing up yet. 
* On that note ^ It feels like there's a lot of information buried in the bottom-left-hand side of the Dashboard, actions at an account-level, project-level, and user-level are grouped together 
* I don't know what to expect with notifications, I'd love to see an example (like a placeholder)  notification loaded up with an explanation of where it's from. i.e. is it like mailchimp notifications? does it show me info about when my card is declined, or is this where I'm going to get a reverse-cron list of feedback items?
* when i hit `https://getcandid.io/dashboard` it says "lets start a project" (which i thought that might mean that my project hadn't been saved) and when I click it it takes me to upgrade and notifies me that I'm at the project limit. it feels like a good place to list projects and have a "wanna add another project? You're gonna need to pay for that, champ" kinda thing.
