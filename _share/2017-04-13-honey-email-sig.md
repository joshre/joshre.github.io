## How to setup your email signature.

Now that youâ€™ve filled your name in, youâ€™re ready to copy and paste your signature into your email. The detail involved in these steps is on purpose. Email signatures are finicky and this is the only freaking way to make it work.

### Apple Mail

1. Your system needs to be updatedÂ â€”Â you should be on macOS Sierra at the time of me writing this and thereâ€™s a solid chance it wonâ€™t work the way Iâ€™m setting it up if you donâ€™t update. [Hereâ€™s a link to update](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12), you can download it in the morning and update while youâ€™re at lunch.
2. Youâ€™re going to select *by clicking and dragging* your email signature. You donâ€™t want any of the text that says `Dont Copy this.`. Copy it to your clipboard.
3. Force-quit mail, we want to start fresh.
4. Open mail, click `Preferences..` and find the `signatures` tab.
5. Click the `All Signatures` pane on the left side.
6. **Delete your old signature**, you donâ€™t need it and if youâ€™re feeling sentimental I can print out the old one for youâ€”heck, we can even frame it.
7. Click the `+` icon on the bottom of the page.
8. Name your signature, donâ€™t leave it as `Signature #1`. If youâ€™re looking for inspiration: look no further than your own name, *itâ€™s perfect.*
9. Thereâ€™s a checkbox labeled `Always match my default message font`, make sure itâ€™s **unchecked**, itâ€™ll make your signature all screwy.
10. Click inside the signature pane above, it probably has your name and email, select all `âŒ˜ + A` and delete.
11. Now, paste in the contents of your keyboard.
12. To make your signature appear while writing messages, **drag** the signature to the account on the left. Do this by clicking on the title of the signature (prolly your name) and dragging over to your honey work account on the left side.
13. Before you send a message, force quit and re-open mail.
	 
### Gmail

1. Youâ€™re going to select *by clicking and dragging* your email signature. You donâ€™t want any of the text that says `Dont Copy this.`. Copy it to your clipboard.
2. Navigate to gmail settings from your inbox by clicking the `gear icon` and then clicking `settings`
3. Scroll down to **Signature** and paste that sucker in there.
4. Thatâ€™s it, thereâ€™s no step 4.
