# Agencies / Startup-ey jobs

## AngelList

##### [angel.co](https://angel.co/)

AngelList is a site where people keep a bunch of info on different startups, their valuations, what they're up to, etc; but they've got a pretty cool jobs section where you can browse by location based on skill or job-type.


## Sacramento Agencies
Don't know a _ton_ about all of these, but hitting them up and letting them know what you're interested in could generate a bunch of leads for other places that they might know to hit-up, they're all Midtown-ish places.

### [Page Design](http://www.pagedesigngroup.com/)
They're right across the street from temple/revolution wine. Not super familiar with their work but I've heard them mentioned quite a few times.

### [3Fold](http://3foldcomm.com/)
Also not familiar with their work, but have heard about them, I think they're pretty close to the new temple. Worth hitting up.

### [Glass Agency](http://glassagency.com/)
These guys are a little more established in the area, they're a more traditional marketing firm.

### [Wallrich](http://www.wallrich.us/)
They do pretty much everything, they're in the midtown area, I can't remember specifically where.
