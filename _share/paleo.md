### Overview

Welcome to WordPress! This should be pretty basic to understand, but there will be screen shots and images included to help you find your way throughout the site. 

You should have a WordPress login. This will be made up of a `username` and a `password` — go ahead and use those credentials to login at the __admin domain:__

* [paleoshoes.com/wp-admin/](http://paleoshoes.com/wp-admin/)

Now that you're logged in, what you're looking at is the WordPress dashboard. Think of it as your backend “homepage” — you can get to everything from here, and it’s where WordPress will automatically take you when you login.

So, we’re going to walk through a few things to get you up-to-speed on how the website works, once we go through them you’'l be a *WordPress expert.* Very fancy. 

Let's get started.

### Editing Pages

This is how you will be doing the majority of your edits to the site; which is great, because its simple! After you have logged into the site, every page should have a black bar across the top. This is called the "Admin bar" and is a good route to editing pages.

We'll start of by looking at how to edit the homepage—after you get that down, it should be pretty simple to infer how other pages work. The most important part is to identify and recognize which parts of the backend relate to which parts of the frontend, and that will be easy to pickup.

__Editing The Homepage__

1. Navigate to your homepage. (you can just click this link [http://paleoshoes.com/](http://paleoshoes.com/))
2. You will see a black bar ontop of the page that has some white text (starting with "paleo shoes, customize, etc")
3. Click the  link that says "Edit Frontpage"

__You're going to see a lot of settings now, but we'll break them done one-by-one so you know what each piece does.__


Your screen should look something like this:

![Homepage Backend](https://d1zjcuqflbd5k.cloudfront.net/files/acc_470387/18bAc?response-content-disposition=inline;%20filename=Screen%20Shot%202016-03-25%20at%202.20.22%20PM.png&Expires=1458941334&Signature=V9Agz6sLuf5Zz5zuiawofrIFZASLzr1BlZN483t2rlCSsW6ujSE3hsKT7LgPggi5OyVys4uKkzwJvXHGMg4vftHMXSzY28~kEfhUzPxQSanj~YiC~utk2hSBIon3UQ4wpJCrCpBK0dSE3qfzq~7sShUJ5e0g-Fkf3-1Ypjt4c9E_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJTEIOJM3LSMN33SA)


__Introductory Text__  
This is the image that displays ontop of the image on the homepage, currently it says `Forty years of marathon and ultra-marathon running inspired the creation of the simplest athletic footwear possible, the revolutionary Barefoot…with Sole®`

When you edit this text, you can see what it will look like by clicking `preview changes`:

![Preview Changes](https://d1zjcuqflbd5k.cloudfront.net/files/acc_470387/15LiN?response-content-disposition=inline;%20filename=Screen%20Shot%202016-03-25%20at%202.13.51%20PM.png&Expires=1458941275&Signature=WNy3vMRWwUQDgQ8GiGP8XFm0o17dEg3uEtbIqvhYCyMz7HWNj3H0UjFmw8gazRIAQTS-lylEEmxaoKealzzIKGxRSHmad4FM6n9pT4BQ6idXsKzRyNQbZI5UvjroaxqgyHPs3Kp0hIMpkrTOh1D3EVFNbjZjnl3e6TRBLxGhwxo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJTEIOJM3LSMN33SA)

Next you should see some product sections with 3 of your products. These are the fields that will allow you to make changes to the 3 featured products on the homepage. You can see the three of them in the screenshot below, with one `single product feature` circled in red. 

![Product Features](https://d1zjcuqflbd5k.cloudfront.net/files/acc_470387/MSO?response-content-disposition=inline;%20filename=Screen%20Shot%202016-03-25%20at%202.26.43%20PM.png&Expires=1458942031&Signature=XwpBsAOONjs5Xyw-R2wfQcUs7TGxbCosHw59qEhVi-uTjB2NsPtlaJRbUvAVOR4ZyU1zEOmpV-7O5n-~ugVhAyTI~r2aYusFgSnAsyz1O4IuENc5aKpAL2LwL5xbrz6bog8sQrYZayrde3whkMLGJOUHeppBsK49qonFuvsiGEE_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJTEIOJM3LSMN33SA)


The fields are as follows:

* Product Feature URL
* Product Feature Image 
* Product Feature Title
* Product Feature Description

And here's an image explaining each one (except the URL since you can't see it):

Once you make changes, click "Update" in the top right corner, you're good to go!
