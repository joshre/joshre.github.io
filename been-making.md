# Chorizo
Saturday April 1, 2017 at 4:39 PM
* * * 


# Ketchup
Saturday April 1, 2017 at 4:39 PM
* * * 

* 85 Apple cider vinegar
* 20 ml Raspberry vinegar 
* 770g canned tomatoes (accidentally got one with basil, hah)
* Spice Kit
* 85g brown sugar
* 2 Cloves Garlic
* 1 small Diced Yellow onion


Spice Kit
* 4 Cloves
* 4 Allspice Berries
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 4 peppercorns

Added vinegar and onion to pan, simmered for 5 minutes, added other ingredients and simmered for about an hour. Blended until smooth [^1491323800-1].

[^1491323800-1]: By smooth, I mean as smooth as our awful blender can make something smooth. This ketchup is *chunky*


# Canned Carrots
Saturday March 25, 2017  
* * * 

Used the same brine as the [Canned Leeks](ulysses://x-callback-url/open?id=7stcAAOubTB6WfbV5_flMg). Pulled this recipe from Sherri Brooks Vinton. “Put 'em Up!.” — I used the brine recipe from the pickled spring ramps and then realized after that it’s intended as a non-processed recipe so these might come out a bit odd.

**Ingredients**
* 440 ml vinegar
* 440 ml water
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp salt
* 1 preserved lemon
* 2 tbsp peppercorns 

Chopped off tops, added to jars with the spices. Brought brine to a boil and poured over the Carrots. 

# Canned Asparagus
Sunday March 26, 2017  
* * * 

Pulled recipe from Sherri Brooks Vinton. “Put 'em Up!.”

Bought 6 bunches of asparagus at farmers market, processed day-of.

* 4 pounds asparagus, washed and dried
* 4 cups cider vinegar
* 1 cup water
* ¼ cup salt
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 4 garlic cloves, sliced
* 1 tablespoon mustard seed
* 1 teaspoon peppercorns

Doubled the brine.

Asparagus smelled really briny, almost fishy, it got somewhat overwhelming at one point. Washed and cut asparagus to size. Filled 2 jars with the remaining ends. Brought brine to a boil and poured over asparagus. There was a little more brine needed so I topped of the 2 jars of random asparagus with some distilled white vinegar.

Processed for 15 minutes

# Canned Garlic Scapes
March 26, 2017
* * * 

Used the same brine as the [canned Onions](ulysses://x-callback-url/open?id=bgDTQ7xTQfGcR1zAkfigpA), which I got from the Pickled Red Onions recipe in *Put ‘em Up!*.

**Ingredients**  
* 2 Cups Distilled White vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 Garlic Clove, Sliced (per jar)
* A sprig or two of dill weed (per jar)
* 0.2 tablespoons yellow mustard seed (per jar)
* 0.2 tablespoons black peppercorns (per jar)
* 5 bunches of scapes, tops chopped off and roots thoroughly washed

Doubled the recipe to cover both sets of veggies.

Removed tops, added mustard seed, peppercorns, and sliced garlic to the jar. Brought the brine to a boil, poured over the scapes, and processed for 5 minutes.

# Canned Onions
March 26, 2017
* * * 

Used the same brine as the [canned Garlic Scapes](ulysses://x-callback-url/open?id=N8OYRGTKWXxZtQjszqObRw), which I got from the Pickled Red Onions recipe in *Put ‘em Up!*.

**Ingredients**  
* 2 Cups Distilled White vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 Garlic Clove, Sliced (per jar)
* A sprig or two of dill weed (per jar)
* 0.5 tablespoons yellow mustard seed (per jar)
* 0.5 tablespoons black peppercorns (per jar)
* 3 White Onions
* 3 Red Onions

Doubled the recipe to cover both sets of veggies.

I sliced the onions, added mustard seed, peppercorns, and sliced garlic to the jars; put 2 white 1 red and 2 red and 1 white onion in jars, accordingly. Brought the brine to a boil, poured over the onions, and processed for 5 minutes.

# Canned Leeks
March 25, 2017 at 2:29 PM
* * * 

Pulled this recipe from Sherri Brooks Vinton. “Put 'em Up!.” — I used the brine recipe from the pickled spring ramps and then realized after that it’s intended as a non-processed recipe so these might come out a bit odd.

726 g leeks before canning (tops might loose a little) 

**Ingredients**
* 440 ml vinegar
* 440 ml water
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp salt
* 1 preserved lemon
* 2 tbsp peppercorns 

Chopped off tops, added to jars with the spices. Brought brine to a boil and poured over the Leeks. 

# Strawberry Jam
March 25, 2017 at 1:54 PM
* * * 

Pulled this recipe from Sherri Brooks Vinton. “Put 'em Up!.” This was my first time making a “Classic Jam” where you add sugar to the fruit in question and let it macerate overnight. It starts exactly like a shrub does, but you don’t toss in any vinegar.

**Ingredients**
* 1112g Strawberries
* 270 g sugar
* 57 ml lemon juice


1. Chopped up Strawberries, added to a crock-like container, poured the sugar over and mixed by hand. Added a lid and left overnight.
2. Next day I put the strawberries and the lemon in the pot and brought to a boil. Processed for about 20 minutes and then poured into a jar.
3. Processed jar for about 5 minutes

Might need a little more time on the boil, the jam is somewhat runny. Or it might be amazing, I think I prefer a slightly less-gelled recipe.

# popcorn

# Cross Rib Roast

2. Sear 
3. Sous Vide

---- 

Rib roast that I got from the butcher at Taylor’s when i took that butchering class.

5lb 8.4oz

# 03/18/2017

* salted each side
* dropped the cast iron on the floor when I was flipping the meat
* set the meat on a cooling rack for about 4 min 
* sautéed a head of garlic and tossed it into the bag 
* added pepper 
* 55° c

Finished in the oven after painting with whipped egg yolk coated with herbs from mom’s garden to finish.

The juices were just under 16oz

On ride over to parents house, the temp dropped significantly, meaning that I cooked it a little longer in the oven. I think this needed a stick of butter in the bag or to stay in the oven so long. Was still amazing, enjoyed in the backyard with a beer and some Bocce ball with the fam.

# Yoghurt

### 01/03/16

* Jars went in 12:35pm
* Water 43° C
* first jar out at 6:04 straight to ice bath 

Too milky — needed more time or needs a stronger starter

### 8/20
- 800 g whole milk
- 64 g yogurt 
- When yogurt went in, didn't completely incorporate — added somewhat evenly to the milk and shaken before added to water bath

Went in at 1:10 am
Water bath 109° F

#### final notes

Needs to stay at 180° longer (I think), didn't have a fully formed consistent solid texture so maybe a bit longer will help the casein denature enough to make it thick?
