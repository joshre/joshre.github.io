I built 2 HTML email templates that were custom-made to work within mailchimp; allowing a content editor to easily open up a pre-made template, put some content in, and send a quick email. Each email was tested on various devices (email clients are fragmented and can give vastly different results) and setup to work within mailchimp.

Emails function natively with mailchimp, so a custom-built email is easy to send.
