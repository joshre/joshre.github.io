This one was a lot of fun. It was a little project I worked on over thanksgiving break a few years back. It was a good way to work on my Jekyll setup and play arround with SVGs. I recently [^veg-1]  re-did a little bit of it and added in a few SVG animations (homepage) and converted all of the images to SVGs.

The idea was to make a site that a list of various vegetables you might find in a grocery store and throw a few ways to cook/prepare them. Showing how quick, easy, and cheap eatiing healthy is. The site sort-of sat for a while, and I've recently began filling in content where there's `lorem ipsum` as I figure out different ways to prepare things.

[^veg-1]: When I realized I had forgotten to renew the domain.
