This one was a lot of fun. It was a little project I worked on over thanksgiving break a few years back. It was a good way to work on my Jekyll setup and play arround with SVGs. I recently [^veg-1]  re-did a little bit of it and added in a few SVG animations (homepage) and converted all of the images to SVGs. The site is super fast because I didn't bother with any javascript and compressed all of the assets, I'm pretty proud of it.


[^veg-1]: When I realized I had forgotten to renew the domain.
