When we (Bamboo Creative) re-branded the City of Rockin, CA they wanted to showcase the new look at an event that was to take place just under a week after the project was to start. They wanted to highlight the "Live, Work, Play" theme so we broke it up into 3 stories to reflect that. Since it needed to be up quick and wouldn't require many changes, I built it in Jekyll.
