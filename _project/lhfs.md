intro: Land Home Financial Services approached us looking for a website that would better serve their branches and loan officers. We saw a few oportunites for them to stand out in the home loan industry as a more empathetic, personality-driven company; and used the website as a medium to leverage that.

offsettitle: Knowledge Center
offsetdetail: Land Home Financial Services needed a way to publish articles that could keep up with modern publications to help position them as a leader in the housing industry, so we built their Knowledge Center. We keep track of pageviews site-wide and use that information to sort by popular articles.
second: Since the site was going to be robust, it was necessary to cut out page-weight wherever possible, so before we started putting pages together we set up a pattern library for each style component; like a custom-made Bootstrap based on SMACSS and BASSCSS.

Part of the project was ensuring that each local branch had it's own site; and that within each branch site each loan officer was represented. To make sure that the large number of sites required were managable, we setup a wordpress multisite install and based each "subsite" off of an API provided from LHFS' intranet.

There are two separate 'installs' that can share a little information with eachother; posts and information from the corporate site can be 'broadcasted' and displayed on the branch sites. So, someone visiting the Sacramento branch would have access to the Glossary, FAQ, and blog posts from the corporate site without leaving the sacramento branch site; all without re-entering and approving a litany of blog posts.
