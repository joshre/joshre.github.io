## Adding A New Component
1. Figure out what you‚Äôre going to call the component `componentName`. Does the team agree on the name? Will it make sense to someone without a development/technical background? Draw out what types of data it will require and where they will be coming from.
- The naming convention for files is `section--componentName‚Äô
	- If you‚Äôre creating a ‚Äúblock‚Äù ‚Äîanything re-used in multiple components‚Äîit should be called `block--componentName`
2. Draw out details on the component and it‚Äôs data, answering these questions:
	- What pieces make up the component?
	- What types of data does each piece include?
	- How does that data get added to the database?
	- What does it look like when it comes back from the database?
		- Images - ID‚Äôs or URL‚Äôs?
		- Dates - Format entered to DB.
		- Arrays
		- Objects? ID‚Äôs referencing other post types?
	- What has to happen to that data for it to be ready for display?
		- Images ‚Äî should they be re-sized?
		- Dates - formats saved, timezones, formats displayed.
	- What happens when there‚Äôs no data?
		- Does it display nothing?
		- Should it display an error? 
		- Should it display default content?
2. Create a markdown file for the documentation
	- `componentName.md`
3. Create an .scss file in the components folder, and link it up within main.scss
	- `scss/_02-components/_section--componentName.scss`
4. Create a twig file with the html written, in the components folder. Note the names written for variables to use in step 5.
	- `/views/components/section--componentName.twig`
5. Build the function to call data for each variable in the `theme.php` file that we‚Äôve linked our `functions.php` file to.

And lastly, I read this book a few months ago and it's super interesting. It's all about the science of alcohol, it's history, and how it's made. It also has a lot of really insightful information about the way alcohol affects people biologically - recommended read üëå
