# About Me

I’m josh, I live in Sacramento, CA with my [wonderful wife](https://www.instagram.com/leilamre/); I’ve been working on the web for about 3-4 years, most of that time has been spent at my current employer [Bamboo Creative](https://bamboocreative.com/). 

About 4 years ago I started making belts, ties, wallets and other odds-and-ends and selling them on etsy—never anything too serious, but enough to cover expenses and spend time tweaking my designs. I called it Trestle Leather Co [^trestle], it was a lot of fun.

While working on Trestle I got involved at Bamboo Creative doing a little sidework—they gave me some space to work on my belts and I paid for it by building websites. Eventually, the web work was more demanding than the leather work was useful, and I’ve been there since. 

I’ve worked on a variety of websites, branding projects, marketing campaigns, prototypes; worked with and without project managers, designers, and have been responsible for handling projects on my own with a client. At one time I was a *"designer"* [^1] when we were in a pinch for social media posts. I can work within a team and have learned how to be adaptable. I'm comfortable in Git, Git-flow, with a PSD or a .sketch file; heck, if you give me an ms-paint file I can make it happen.

## Tech I'm Comfortable With

I'm fluent in HTML5, CSS3, I use Sass/SCSS and like starting with [bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/). I've done a great deal of work in WordPress, here's my boilerplate theme: [buscemi](https://github.com/joshre/buscemi). 

#### Languages I frequently use:

- PHP
- Twig
- Markdown
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- MySQL

The site you're looking at is built in Jekyll using bourbon/neat as well as the Sass framework I like to use, if you're interested in skimming through the code [you can do that here](https://github.com/joshre/joshre.github.io).

#### Miscellaneous Things I Have Experience With:

- Hosting & Managing Sites on Linux
- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
- HTML Emails
- Git
- Web Performance Optimization
- Writing Site Documentation

## Software I Use

I work in Mac OSX. I'm comfortable in most design programs and can make my way through a poorly-formatted PSD or .AI file if needed; I know all the basics (like word, excel), and am pretty handy with Google Docs. Often I'm tasked as the office IT guy, so I'm used setting up printers and fixing the Wifi network; and am usually the person hounding everyone in the office to make sure their computers are properly backed up. 


- Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign, Audition
- Sketch
- Adobe 
- Word, Pages, etc
- Excel, Numbers, Google Docs
