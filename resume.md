# About Me

> __Note__  
> I made this beginning of 2016 when I was mid-job search, while I've updated it to be accurate I&rsquo;m probably not going to touch it for quite some time, so It won't have new info. But I like how it looks and I'm linking to it from the home page. (╯&deg;□&deg;）╯︵ ┻━┻

I’m josh, I live in Sacramento, CA with my [wonderful wife](https://www.instagram.com/leilamre/); I’ve been working on the web for about 3-4 years, a lot of that time was spent at [Bamboo Creative](https://bamboocreative.com/). 

About 4 years ago I started making belts, ties, wallets and other odds-and-ends and selling them on etsy—never anything too serious, but enough to cover expenses and spend time tweaking my designs. I called it Trestle Leather Co [^trestle], it was a lot of fun.

While working on Trestle I got involved at Bamboo Creative doing a little sidework—they gave me some space to work on my belts and I paid for it by building websites. Eventually, the web work was more demanding than the leather work was useful, and was there up untill January 2016

I’ve worked on a variety of websites, branding projects, marketing campaigns, prototypes; worked with and without project managers, designers, and have been responsible for handling projects on my own with a client. At one time I was a *"designer"* [^1] when we were in a pinch for social media posts. I can work within a team and have learned how to be adaptable. I'm comfortable in Git, Git-flow, with a PSD or a .sketch file; heck, if you give me an ms-paint file I can make it happen.

## Tech I'm Comfortable With

I'm fluent in HTML5, CSS3, I use Sass/SCSS. I build things fast with Jekyll; and am pretty quick at spinning up, configuring and managing a linux server. I've done a great deal of work in WordPress (here's my boilerplate theme: [buscemi](https://github.com/joshre/buscemi).)

**Languages I frequently use:**

- PHP
- Twig
- Markdown
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- MySQL

The site you're looking at is built in Jekyll using bourbon/neat as well as the Sass framework I made and frequently use, if you're interested in skimming through the code [you can do that here](https://github.com/joshre/joshre.github.io).

**Miscellaneous Things I Have Experience With:**

- Hosting & Maintaining Linux Servers
- Apache
- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
- DNS Setup
- Responsive HTML Emails
- Git
- Web Performance
- Writing Site Documentation
- Command Line
- Vim

## Software I Use

I work in Mac OSX. I'm comfortable in most design programs and can make my way through a poorly-formatted PSD or .AI file if needed; I know all the basics (like word, excel), and am pretty handy with Google Docs. Often I'm tasked as the office IT guy, so I'm used setting up printers and fixing the Wifi network; and am usually the person hounding everyone in the office to make sure their computers are properly backed up. 


- Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign, Audition
- Sketch
- Adobe 
- Word, Pages, etc
- Excel, Numbers, Google Docs
