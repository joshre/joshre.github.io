#### To Scale: The Solar System
These guys built a scale model of our solar system since they couldn't find any accurate scale-models online. Come to think of it, any “scale” models of our solar system that seemed realistic to me were the ones they’d paint across an elementary school playground. But even the planets on those weren’t to-scale. You can watch it here on youtube.[^1].

#### 3-D printed nerve guides
Think of them as a “cast” for broken nerves; a bunch of researchers from Universities across the states have [developed a way](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201501760/abstract) to regenerate complex nerves by custom-fitting a guide for them to grow back in.

It's not as simple as a cast you slap on a broken arm, though; with many nerves, different functions are controlled and relayed down different paths, and researchers were able to embed biological cues for the nerves within the cast, enabling propper growth.

The implications of this means that in the near future, hospitals equipped with scanners and 3D-printers will be able to scan and custom-fit these guides for complex nerves like the saiatic nerve—which is shaped like a "Y"—which has up until this point been an impossible feat.

“This represents an important proof of concept of the 3D printing of custom nerve guides for the regeneration of complex nerve injuries,” said University of Minnesota mechanical engineering professor Michael McAlpine, the study’s lead researcher. “Someday we hope that we could have a 3D scanner and printer right at the hospital to create custom nerve guides right on site to restore nerve function.”
