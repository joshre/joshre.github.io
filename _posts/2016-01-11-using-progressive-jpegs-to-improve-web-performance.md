Most of the web consists of images. Part of responsibly building a CMS is ensuring that things like image sizes and formats are taken into consideration before laying too much groundwork.

My priority list for image optimiziation goes somewhat like this:

1. Use Less Images *(duh)*
2. Use [Responsive Images]({% post_url 2016-01-11-using-the-responsive-image-spec-to-improve-web-performance %})
3. Use SVG when possible.
4. Use PNG's for less-graphic intensive contents when SVG isn't possible
  - text, line drawings, and icons
5. Use progressive JPG's
6. Use JPG's
