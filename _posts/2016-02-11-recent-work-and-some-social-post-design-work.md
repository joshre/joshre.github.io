Hey there! This is probably the best format for me to send over some work.

[Skip to wireframing, content mapping, etc](#wireframing-and-content-mapping)

# Social Images

I dug through some old folders and found a lot more graphics, turns out I was doing this more than I remember haha. Lots of them are for Zocalo, I definitely remember them being the client I did the most work for. The images were for a bunch of different social networks, so resolution and aspect ratio are somewhat irrelevant in this context.

## Zocalo Food For ___

This was a campaign for Zocalo that sort of happened by accident, it started with the “Food For: *Change*” concept and turned into a more robust campaign as it was used more and more.

## Zocalo Mole Infographic

This was an infographic I made when we were focusing a lot on Zocalo's Mole recipe. This image is just a clip, [take a look at the full thing here.](/images/posts/social/infographic.pdf)

## Zocalo Storm Image

In December 2014, there was some big storm that [everyone](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article4369058.html) was [freaking](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article4438871.html) out about. (except in Tahoe, [they were catching swells](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article4436490.html)) and I threw this together as a joke. We ended up going with it and it got something like 700% the traffic for a normal Zocalo post at the time.

## World Cup

Zocalo was huge on the world cup, so I put together an Illustrator file that had vector flags of each team in the world cup as well as their abbreviations so we could quickly spit-out graphics once the standings from each game showed upcoming games.

## Lincoln Brewster Graphics

A lot of the Lincoln graphics came from periods where we were working his social and his label wasn't working quick enough to pump out graphics when we needed them.

## UYWI

Urban Youth Workers International already had a style-guide with textures and what-not, this was just a lot of isolating images and cranking out posts

## Zipit
This was the first project where I was throwing together social images. Zipit was a client that made [a tool that helps people open the really annoying blister packages](http://www.amazon.com/ZipIt-Opener-Electric-Blister-Package/dp/B001QXOMWC/ ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455256775&sr=8-1&keywords=zipit+opener) that everything comes in. We came up with the campaign "Open Happiness" and made a ton of graphics with the word/theme "open," *a little* contrived, but still a starting point. Here are a few of the images I made:

# Wireframing and Content Mapping

Generally, the work before developing a site looks somewhat like this:

1. Site Map
2. Wire-Frame
3. Style Package
4. (dev) Content Mapping 
	- laying-out every field of data on the site
	- setting up content requirements for the client

Everything gets named before it gets coded, and everything is approached from a scale of lowest complexity to highest complexity. That way time isn't lost on unnecessary details, we work faster, and we don't get burnt-out with exessive cognitive load.

## Here's a sitemap I made for a client

## Part of the content-map for the above wireframe

Usually, I take a ton of Post-Its, put on some headphones, write-out every field that will be needed (backend and frontend), and throw it up on a whiteboard. I'll usually take a day on this, adding it to the process cut out about four days of clean-up and class-naming at the end of the project.

Wireframing can happen for a few different places for me. Lately, I've been using [Paper By FiftyThree](https://www.fiftythree.com/) since it automatically makes shapes while still keeping the messy feel that wireframes use to their advantage with clients. Other than that, I use [Graph Paper](/images/posts/wire/graph-rocklin.JPG), [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc), and usually try and stay out of normal design programs.

## This is a piece of the wireframe set for LHFS

You can check-out the site here: [lhfsit.com](http://lhfsit.com/)

This site is a great example of how I componentized everything. Since it was so robust it required a lot of planning with each piece, so I sometimes had to do fast sketches to make sure that I grasped what I was putting together before I started working.

## Serve Day Natural Language Search Results

When we built serveday, we were trying to find a better way to search and filter events that a user was looking for and kept running into the problem of people not really understanding where they were in the filtering process, or how they got the results they were looking at. To fix it, we opted to display results with natural-language information. The image below shows what this looks like, but you can see it [live here](http://serve.baysideonline.com/projects/?action=search_events&category=5&scope=2015-10-10%2C2015-10-10&town=Auburn)
