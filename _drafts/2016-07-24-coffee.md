Like a lot of things that I've started making and have fallen in love with, coffee started out as me trying to find a cost-effective way to have _okayish_ coffee all the time. My options were:

1. Infrequent __great__[^4] coffee
2. Consistent __okay__ [^5] coffee
3. Crap coffee
4. No Coffee

In this case, I prefer the __No Coffee__ to the __Crap Coffee__ (sour coffee) [^6] but didn't want to throw down the cash for the __Great Coffee__. 

[^4]: 8-9/10 on my "goodness" scale
[^5]: 6.5-8/10 on my "goodness" scale
