These are a few _very_ useful resources (as well as a few random things from myself) on web performance.

## Image Optimization Tools

I compress images before I send them on iMessage, I'm neruotic about this stuff. So when it comes to delivering images in the browser (and probably over a terrible internet connection), image optimization is a no-brainer. These ones are free and pretty simple.

- [**SVGO**](https://github.com/svg/svgo) - this is a cli on node that always saves me at least a few kb on SVG's
- [**ImageOptim**](https://imageoptim.com/) - You'd be amazed how much space can be saved in PNG files (like, 30-50%). This is free and works fast as heck. 
- [**ImageMagick**](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) - Do literally anything to literally any image type. I use this to easily sort through a folder of images, find the jpegs, check if they're progressive, and make them progressive if they're not yet.
