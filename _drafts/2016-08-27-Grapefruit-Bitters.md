I just read Brad Thomas Parsons' book [Bitters: A Spirited History of a Classic Cure-All, with Cocktails, Recipes, and Formulas](http://amzn.to/2bvSmdI) and had some grapefruit peel lying around, so I decided to try his Grapefruit bitters recipe. 

**First Part**  

This'll sit for about two weeks, then there are a few more steps.

- Used a Y-peeler to remove zest from 2 ruby red grapefruit
- ~ ¼ cup chopped dried grapefruit peel
- ½ teaspoon gentian root
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 6 green cardamom pods, cracked with a muddler (black seeds inside fall out)
- 1 teaspoon dried hops

Started with 2 cups Titos vodka, added a small amount more to cover everything 

Final Weight ~ 13oz

Next step will happen in 2 weeks - then one more week after that 👌
