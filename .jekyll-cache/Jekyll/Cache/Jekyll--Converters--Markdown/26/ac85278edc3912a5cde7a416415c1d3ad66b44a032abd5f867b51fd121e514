I"û<p class="lead-paragraph">Hey, Iâ€™m Josh. I get a kick out of making stuff and have a lot of hobbies. From food, drinks, to the web I make, break, and fix things.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a web developer working at <a href="https://workbyhoney.com/">Honey</a> in Sacramento, CA. Most places on the internet you can generally find me as <code class="highlighter-rouge">joshre</code>. lets be friends there. If youâ€™re into <strong>Twitter</strong> my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/_joshre">@_joshre</a>, on <strong>Github</strong> you can find me under <a href="http://github.com/joshre">joshre</a>, and if you like music Iâ€™m <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/joshre">@joshre</a> on apple music.</p>

## Hobbies

Most of my time outside of work is spent on food, it's a hobby that started as an interest and bloomed into obsession a few years ago. I usually have 2-3 projects every week or so, and I keep a somewhat updated list here: [Things I've Been Making](/been-making/) -->
