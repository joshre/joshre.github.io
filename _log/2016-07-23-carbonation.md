My CO<sub>2</sub> rig is pretty much copied from Dave Arnold's Liquid intelligence,[^1] it consists of:

* 5lb CO<sub>2</sub> tank [^2]
* [Pressure Regulator](http://amzn.to/1UB61fL) (the sort you get for a home brew setup)
* [CarbaCap](http://amzn.to/1UB4XID)[^3] — these are clever: screw it onto a soda-bottle cap and all you need is a ball-lock adapter to force in some gas.
* [5/16" Gas Line Assembly - Ball Lock](http://amzn.to/1UB5TNh)

[^2]: If you're in Sacramento, hit up [Brew Ferment Distill](http://brewfermentdistill.com/) — $90 deposit w/ a $20 refill—I'll only probably end up re-filling 3-4 times a year, it's a lot of gas.
