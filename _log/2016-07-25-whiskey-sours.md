With whiskey sours, you usually shake your ingredients with egg white before you throw in ice to chill them, it forces in some air and gives it a nice texture. These are cool because you're substituting the egg with the texture of the CO<sub>2</sub>. An egg-white Whiskey sour and a carbonated one aren't really comparable—they're _just_ different enough to kinda be different products.

When you're carbonating, it's pretty important that the liquid you're about to force CO<sub>2</sub> into is as clear as possible. Bubbles form on any solute (the thing dissolving _into_ your liquid) that's floating around in there. To help, I use [Pectinase](http://amzn.to/2665YAz) (it's the stuff they use to clear up wine) to break-down the cloudy bits in the lemon juice.

1. Mix
2. Chill (ideally between –5° and –10°C)
3. Carbonate
